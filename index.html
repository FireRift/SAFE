    Our district wide expectation is SAFE: S. A. F. E. Safe, Accountable, Fidelity, Excellence. What does that mean?
S is for Safe: Masks keep us safe when worn properly. The proper way to remain safe is to wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth.
A is for Accountable: You are accountable when  you wear your mask at all times. You are responsible for wearing a mask properly
F is for Fidelity: You are making sure that all parts of your face are covered correctly. You bring your mask daily. If you have forgotten a mask, it is ok to ask for one.
E is for Excellence: We take pride in keeping ourselves and others safe wearing our masks. It is our time to shine, and we shine brightly when we wear our masks.
