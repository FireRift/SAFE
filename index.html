     <div class="script"> 
<p>    Our district wide expectation is <span class="safe">SAFE: S. A. F. E. Safe, Accountable, Fidelity, Excellence.</span> What does that mean?<br />
S is for Safe: Masks keep us safe when worn properly. The proper way to remain safe is to wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth.<br />
A is for Accountable: You are accountable when  you wear your mask at all times. You are responsible for wearing a mask properly.<br />
F is for Fidelity: You are making sure that all parts of your face are covered correctly. You bring your mask daily. If you have forgotten a mask, it is ok to ask for one.<br />
E is for Excellence: We take pride in keeping ourselves and others safe wearing our masks. It is our time to shine, and we shine brightly when we wear our masks.<br />
